## Abstract


The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) provides comprehensive data on demographics, sociology, health, and nutrition. Conducted in two-year cycles since 1999, most of its data are publicly accessible, making it pivotal for research areas like social determinants of health and tracking trends in obesity and other health metrics. Assembling the data and analyzing it present a number of technical and analytic challenges. This paper introduces the `nhanesA` package, designed to assist researchers in data retrieval, analysis, and to enable the sharing and extending of prior efforts. We believe that fostering community-driven efforts in data reproducibility and sharing of analytic methods will greatly benefit the scientific community and propel scientific advancements.

## Introduction

NHANES @cdc2023 is a pivotal program dedicated to assessing the health and nutritional status of both adults and children in the United States. Its value stems from its comprehensive approach that merges detailed interviews and thorough physical examinations. NHANES is administered by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), an integral part of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), tasked with generating crucial health and vital statistics for the entire nation.
 
Since 1999, NHANES has transitioned to a continuous survey format, distinctively termed "continuous NHANES" to differentiate it from its preceding versions. Continuous NHANES surveys are grouped in two-year *cycles*, with the inaugural cycle rolled out in 1999-2000. A PubMed @mih2023 search reveals that NHANES is referenced almost 5,000 times annually, highlighting its significance in the research community. The vast majority of the NHANES data are available for download from the CDC website, which also offers comprehensive guidance on data utilization, downloading procedures, and analytical methodologies.

NHANES employs a distinct sampling strategy that captures data from demographic groups often missing or underrepresented in many epidemiology studies. These include a broad range of ethnicities, age groups that range from infants to the elderly, and they intentionally oversample less prevalent populations. NHANES serves as a useful tool for studying both prevalence of, and temporal shifts in, critical public health issues such as obesity and social determinants of health. While each cycle is cross-sectional, one can examine the sequential order of cycles to get a sense of evolving population characteristics over time. The sampling design adds a layer of complexity to the analysis and researchers must be careful to use appropriate survey methodologies. To facilitate the analysis of NHANES data the `nhanesA` package includes a detailed vignette describing the appropriate use of these methods and directs readers to an extensive array of online resources.
 
Replication of published papers remains a demanding endeavor. Even with well-intentioned authors, recreating tables and graphs from their papers proves challenging. This difficulty often stems from a lack of specificity in reporting the extent and manner of data cleaning, the details of inclusion criteria and specific phenotypic definitions. Furthermore, accurately detailing the extent to which the data were transformed or filtered during the analysis, is difficult. While accurate textual description of these processes is hard, they can be succinctly and unambigously described through software. We have incorporated tools in `nhanesA` to make it easier to syncronize the software descriptions of the analysis with the outputs and to easily share the software with interested readers. We also provide a brief outline describing ways in which authors can enhance the reproducibility of their work by readers as a supplement.

## Methods

### Data

The publicly available continuous NHANES data consists of over 1500 different tables, or questionnaires. Each cycle surveys a distinct set of individuals using a cluster sample approach @cdcex2023. Each cycle produces data tables in five categories: Demographics, Dietary, Examination, Laboratory and Questionnaire. There is also limited access data that is not publicly available and requires a formal request for access.

The available data can be downloaded using `https` requests from the CDC website. For each table there are two components, the raw data which is provided in SAS (Statistical Analysis Software) `XPT` (Transport File Format) format and a documentation file, in HTML, that describes the data variables and format. Going forward the CDC plans to revamp the entire survey in the 2023-2024 cycle as documented in @Ram2021.

We next describe a number of the computational and analytic challenges that need to be addressed, highlighting how the `nhanesA` package offers effective and reproducible solutions. 

### Search relevant variables and data files for analysis

While the CDC website provides search capabilities we believe that using dedicated R-based tools offers analysts a way to directly manipulate the research results. Within the `nhanesA` package, we have incorporated advanced search utilities. Functions such as `nhanesSearch`, `nhanesSearchTableNames`, and `nhanesSearchVarName` have been crafted streamline and optimize these search processes.

### Downloading data to your local machine

Using `nhanesA` the data can be downloaded directly into data frames, readying it for subsequent analysis. The function `nhanes` takes the name of the table that is wanted and downloads it. Categorical variables, both ordered and unordered, are encoded as integers. In Figure \ref{fig:DEMO_J} we show the translated and untranslated variables `RIAGENDR` and `RIDRETH1` from `DEMO_J`. Where, for example, the untranslated values for `RIAGENDR`  coded as `1` and `2` are translated to `Male` and `Female`.  If an untranslated categorical variable is used in a regression model then the variable would be treated as an integer variable and the corresponding estimates would, in general, not be appropriate. By default the `nhanes` function will translate the data and users can specify that they want the untranslated data by setting the argument `translated` to `FALSE`. 

### Align tables within a cycle or across cycles

After downloading the data tables within a cycle can be synchronized using the `merge` function from R with `SEQN` as the key. Additionally, one can align tables across cycles as long as the data were collected. For example the main demographic questionnaire is present in all cycles. The CDC uses some naming conventions, but these are not always applied consistently and it is important to be cautious when merging or combining data across cycles as the names of the variables are not guaranteed to be constant, and the actual questions may change over time. 

\begin{figure}[h]
  \includegraphics[width=3.5in]{images/translated.jpg}
  \caption{a) shows the raw data the both gender and ethnicity are encoded as integers. b) shows the translated data.}
  \label{fig:DEMO_J}
\end{figure}


### Use the survey weights to obtain valid estimates

NHANES uses a complex, four-stage sample design and appropriate analyses typically involve using specialized survey analysis procedures that use special weights that account for the sampling scheme that was used to collect the data. Each sample person is assigned a sample weight, reflecting the number of people in the broader population that the individual represents. To obtain valid estimates from the data, it's essential to apply these survey weights during analysis. By doing so, researchers account for the complex survey design and some potential biases, ensuring the results are reflective of the entire population and not just the sampled individuals. There is extensive documentation provided on the CDC website describing the proper use of these weights @cdcwgt2023. 
We recommend using the `survey` @JSSv009i08 package to perform these analyses. We provide a simple example later in this paper and more extensive examples in the vignettes for the `nhanesA` and `phonto` @phonto2023 packages.

## An Example

We now demonstrate the use of the `nhanesA` package, together with the `survey` package to look at average blood pressure for individuals over 40 years of age by reported ethnicity for the 2017-2018 cycle. For that we download and merge the demographic data (`DEMO_J`) and the blood pressure data (`BPX_J`). 

```{r loadlibs, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library("nhanesA")
library("survey")
library("knitr")
```

```{r demoj, eval=T}
demoj = nhanes("DEMO_J")
dim(demoj)

## merge DEMO_J and BPX_J using SEQN.  
bpxj = nhanes("BPX_J")
data = merge(demoj, bpxj, by="SEQN")
dim(data)
```

In order to make appropriate estimates we will need to create a survey design object to incorporate the weights into our analysis. It is essential to create the survey design structure prior to doing any subsetting of your data. This ensures that the complex survey design features, such as stratification and clustering, are accurately captured and applied to the entire dataset. The CDC provides detailed explanations at @cdcwgt2023. 


```{r survery}
nhanesDesign <- svydesign(id = ~SDMVPSU,  # Primary Sampling Units (PSU)
                          strata  = ~SDMVSTRA, # Stratification used in the survey
                          weights = ~WTMEC2YR,   # Survey weights
                          nest    = TRUE,      # Whether PSUs are nested within strata
                          data    = data)

```


Next we subset the data to contain only subjects over 40 years of age. We use the tools in the `survey` package to that appropriate adjustment of weights is made. We also create a second subset that is not contained within a survey design framework so that it is easy to examine the unadjusted values. 


```{r surveydesign}

dfsub = subset(nhanesDesign, data$RIDAGEYR>=40)

datasub = data[data$RIDAGEYR>=40,]

```

Now, we perform the same analysis using the survey weights. First we get the adjusted overall mean for the population 

```{r ethtables}
table(datasub$RIDRETH1) |> kable(col.names=c("Ethnicity", "Freq"))
```

For illustration purposes we examine diasotolic blood pressure and for ease of presentation we only use the first measurement, variable `BPXDI1` in tabel `BPX_J`.
We can compute the unadjusted mean of diastolic blood pressure both for the whole table and also split by ethnicity.
```{r unadjbp}
mean(datasub$BPXDI1, na.rm=TRUE)
##divide the data by RIDRETH1
sp1 = split(datasub$BPXDI1, datasub$RIDRETH1)
mns = sapply(sp1, mean, na.rm=TRUE)

mns = data.frame(Ethnicity = names(mns), "Raw DBP"=mns)
kable(mns, row.names=FALSE)
```

Next we perform the same analysis using the survey weigths. First we compute the adjusted over all mean for the population represented by the data in the table and then also compute adjusted means for each ethnicity and present both those estimates and the unadjusted estimates computed above in a single table.

```{r svyby}
adjmn = svymean(~BPXDI1, dfsub, na.rm=TRUE)
adjmn
# By ethnicity
adjmnsbyEth = svyby(~BPXDI1, ~RIDRETH1, dfsub, svymean, na.rm=TRUE)
kable(adjmnsbyEth[,c(2,3)], col.names=c("Adj DBP","SE"))
##all.equal(names(mns), as.character(adjmnsbyEth$RIDRETH1)

both = cbind(adjmnsbyEth[,c(1,2)], mns[,2] )
kable(both, row.names=FALSE, col.names=c("Ethnicity", "Adj DBP", "Raw DPB"))

```

### Challenging Aspects of the NHANES data

There remain some challenges to analyzing the NHANES data for which there are no easy ways to address the issues. We discuss a number of the issues here in order to alert analysts to their existence so they can remediate any impacts. 

Within NHANES there is a substantial amount of missing data. In part this arises from non-response but it can also arise due to the fact that not all respondents participate in all of the assays, exams or questionnaires. In other settings missingness can be introduced by the process used to deliver the survey. We show an excerpt of the Blood Pressure and Cholesterol documentation for 2005-2006 in Figure \ref{fig:BPQ_020}. You can see that in question BPQ_020 that anyone who answered either *No* or *Don’t know* to the question skipped over question BPQ_030, as it makes little sense for them. Importantly the value stored in the database for those people for BPQ_030 was a missing value. Now, in some circumstances an analyst might prefer to assume that if the respondent had not been told that they had high blood pressure once, they also had not been told they had high blood pressure two or more times. They would then fill in those missing values as *No* so that they had more complete case information for their analysis. There are many instances in the NHANES data where questions are skipped as part of the survey delivery and it is important that the analyst try to detect those and make reasonable assumptions for the analysis. 


\begin{figure*}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=4.5in]{images/BPQ020D.png}
  \caption{Question BPQ\_020 from BPQ\_D.}
  \label{fig:BPQ_020}
\end{figure*}


In the NHANES dataset, data coarsening is frequently observed. For instance, the age variable (RIDAGEYR in DEMO_J) uses a representation where the value 80 denotes individuals aged 80 and above. Similarly, the ratio of family income to poverty (INDFMPIR) uses the value 5 to indicate a ratio greater than or equal to 5.00. These practices compromise the precision of numerical values in the dataset. Additionally, some variables, although expressed numerically, are better interpreted as categorical data. Take the Body Mass Index ($11.5 \sim 67.3 kg/m^2$, represented as BMXBMI in BMX_J) for example. While it is expressed as a continuous number, categorizing it into predefined ranges such as underweight (<18.5), healthy weight (18.5 to <25), overweight (25.0 to <30), and obesity (30.0 or higher) might yield more meaningful analyses.

During the 2019-2020 cycle data collection was disrupted by the pandemic. Therefore, the partial 2019-2020 data (herein 2019-March 2020 data) were combined with the full data set from the previous cycle (2017-2018) to create nationally representative 2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic data files.  These data files have the same basic file name, e.g. `DEMO`, but they are named by prepending a `P_` to that, giving `P_DEMO`. These files require special handling and the CDC has provided substantial guidance as well as updating the survey weights etc.

## Other Approaches

### R Packages

There are several other R packages that pertain to NHANES, including `nhanesaccel` @Domelen2020, `AsthmaNHANES` @sun2021, `NHANES` @Pruim2015, and `RNHANES` @Susmann2016. The first three pertain to specific subsets of NHANES data and are not designed for comprehensive access and use. The `RNHANES` package has functions to download and process continuous NHANES data, however, the package has not been maintained actively on CRAN and is not compatible with recent updates such as pre-pandemic data.

The `NHANES` package @Pruim2015 provides a subset of data from the 2009-2010 and 2011-2012 cycles. The authors have created a small subset of the data for teaching purposes. They have included 75 variables and created two datasets. The `NHANESraw` dataframe is the raw data together with information on the sample weighting scheme. Their `NHANES` dataframe contains 10,000 rows that were resampled from 'NHANESraw' that *undid* the oversampling and hence analyses using `NHANES` can be performed without using the survey weights. The authors are quite explicit that this is a teaching resource and that any scientific investigations should rely on the data from the NHANES CDC site and not on their subset.

The `RNHANES` package @Susmann2016 is produced by the Silent Spring Institute.
RNHANES provides an easy way to download and analyze data from NHANES with a focus on the laboratory data. They provide methods to find all data files and to download them. They provide a search capability as well as making some attempt to obtain the units of measurement for the laboratory data.  The `nhanes_load_data` function provides a method for downloading and merging data, although the features are limited. It also has arguments to allow for recording/translating the factor variables, although that seemed to be very slow to run.  There are good functions that encapsulate the use of the `survey` package, but that seems to be at the expense of flexibility in the analysis.

### Stata

We did not find any Stata modules or packages but there are good resources available on the web, such as those from the Statistical Consulting Unit at UCLA @UCLA2023.

### Python

We are aware of two actively maintained Python libraries for working with NHANES data: `nhanes-dl` @LeviButcher and `pynhanes` @Pyrkov2023. In Python, one can use Jupyter notebooks to achieve reproducible results. Jupyter notebooks, similar to Rmarkdown, allow for an organized presentation of text, code, and their respective outputs (including plots) within a single document. This facilitates reproducibility, enabling readers to easily replicate and understand the presented work. However, the `nhanes-dl` library is designed to download Continuous NHANES codebooks and convert them into ready-to-use pandas dataframes, although its documentation is somewhat lacking. The `pynhanes` package  offers several Jupyter notebooks on its GitHub repository @Pyrkov20231 to demonstrate its usage.

## Discussion and future work

NHANES, with its depth and breadth of health and nutritional data, serves as a cornerstone for epidemiologic and health research. However, the intricacies and nuances associated with the data, combined with the varied methodologies employed across different research domains, present considerable analytic challenges. We have described a number of ways in which `nhanesA` can facilitate analyzing these data and have indicated a number of issues that are not easily addressed in software and remain for the analyst to address. 

We believe that there is additional value to be obtained from the many papers based on NHANES and in particular point out that when the reported analyses are reproducible then they also become extensible in at least two directions. First, when studying population characteristics there is substantial value in being able to repeat an analysis when data from a new cycle are released. Second, for any analysis, the ability to extend that analysis using additional covariates from other questionnaires, or to explore the impact of unadjusted for covariates (eg. explore social determinants of health) can be very powerful. 

With regard to reproducibility we mean the computational reproducibility of the figures and tables in a paper. Which essentially means that once the dataset is agreed upon, all analytical outputs can be precisely replicated, while the general scientific reproducibility emphasizes the need to obtain similar results across analogous, though not identical, samples. In the supplement we propose a process that offers a structured approach for researchers using the NHANES dataset. Harnessing the synergy between GitHub, Rmarkdown, and specific packages like `nhanesA`, we set the stage for a transparent, modular, and rigorously organized research process. Every stage, from data selection to preprocessing decisions and analytical procedures, is systematically recorded and versioned, ensuring transparency and reproducibility.  The essential components of this process have been used to write papers and books by many of the contributors to the Bioconductor Project @biocod for the past 20 years or so. We believe that it would be valuable to start a community effort to collect and collate papers based primarily on NHANES data that use strategies to encourage reproducibility and extensibility, regardless of the computing language used.

We believe that encapsulating the public NHANES data into a SQL database that is contained in a Docker @Dirk @docker container is an important next step. This would enable faster access, both due to the data being local to the user and also because the use of SQL and various tools that come with databases better support some of the data manipulations. We are working on a container that also includes an instance of R and R Studio to further encourage reproducibility of results. Such an approach will make it easier to add data resources and create more complex, and hence more valuable data sets.

## Appendix

### Reproducible research

We believe that the `nhanesA` package makes a substantial contribution to enhancing reproducibility and rigor in the scientific process. Here we want to outline a few tools that can be used in conjunction with `nhanesA` to create documents that are reusable and extensible. The reproducibility of a paper, or result, can be enhanced by using a number of tools and processes that are commonly used for software development. We outline these set of tools that we believe are useful and then give a vignette outlining a simplified paper-writing approach that uses these tools. 

An important development was the concept of *Markdown* @Gruber, which is a straightforward markup language designed for crafting formatted text without the intricacies of HTML. Rmarkdown builds upon Markdown, intertwining it with the R programming language. Essentially, Rmarkdown is an implementation of Markdown, allowing users to embed R code within a document. This fusion supports dynamic reporting, where narrative and code coexist, fostering clear, reproducible research outcomes.

@Xie2018 and @Allaire2023  documents which are documents that integrate software (code) and text. These can be thought of as explicit descriptions of how the figures and the tables in the published paper were created. Rmarkdown documents are processed by different *engines* that transform them into specific outputs such as a PDF format for publication or a HTML output for putting on the web. 

A second important tool to help with reproducibility is the use of version control systems. These were originally developed for software development but they work equally well for writing papers. A widely used tool for version control is GitHub @github.  One example of using this approach based on R @R-base is the Epidemiologist R Handbook @Handbook which is written in Bookdown @Xie2020 and is maintained in GitHub @Handbook2. The authors have created an entire textbook using markdown and they use GitHub to handle version issues as well as bug reporting and fixing. This approach has been used widely in the R community for over 20 years with substantial success. It should come as no surprise to the reader that this paper is also written in markdown and uses GitHub as its source code repository @paperself.

#### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that uses simple syntax to format text. Designed for readability and simplicity, it enables the creation of well-structured documents without the complexities of HTML. Common uses include README files, forums, and documentation. With Markdown, elements like headers, links, lists, and bold or italic text are easily achieved using non-intrusive syntax.

Rmarkdown, on the other hand, extends the capabilities of Markdown for the R programming community. It seamlessly integrates the R code with Markdown, allowing users to embed R code chunks within the text. When an Rmarkdown file is executed using tools like knitr, the R code is run, and its outputs (graphs, tables, etc.) are embedded directly into the document. This results in dynamic, interactive reports that combine narrative, code, and output in a single document.

#### Git and GitHub 

**Git:** At its core, Git is a distributed version control system. It allows multiple users to work on the same project without interfering with each other's changes. By maintaining a history of every modification, Git ensures that users can revert to any previous state of their project, thus facilitating a consistent and error-free development process.

**GitHub:** While Git is the underlying system that tracks changes, GitHub is a web-based platform that hosts Git repositories. It provides a visual interface and additional tools for collaboration, making it easier for researchers and developers to share, discuss, and collaborate on their projects.

Key Concepts:


- **Repository (Repo)**: A repository is essentially a project's folder containing all files, folders, and relevant data. It also holds the project's revision history. On GitHub, repositories can be public or private, allowing for open-source collaboration or private work, respectively.

- **Clone**: Cloning refers to creating a copy of a repository from GitHub onto your local machine. This allows researchers to work on their projects offline and synchronize changes later.

- **Commit**: When you make changes to your project, Git tracks them. Committing is the process of saving these changes to the local repository. Every commit requires a message to briefly describe what was done, ensuring future users (or the future you) understand the project's evolution.

- **Push**: Once changes are committed locally, they need to be sent or 'pushed' to the GitHub repository. This ensures that your online repository is up-to-date with your local changes.

- **Merge**: As multiple collaborators work on a project, there will be instances when two or more people modify the same piece of information. Merging is the process of combining different sequences of commits into one unified history, resolving any conflicts that arise.

- **Branch**: In Git, the main line of development is called the 'main' branch. However, when working on new features or testing out ideas without affecting the main line, users can create a 'branch' or a parallel line of development. Once satisfied with the changes, the branch can be 'merged' back into the main line.

### A simplified NHANES paper writing process

Here we sketch out an outline for writing a paper using the tools we mention in order to create a reproducible paper. By reproducible we really mean that once we have agreed on the data to analyze, that all of the tables, graphs and other analyses can be reproduced exactly. Now this is not the concept of scientific reproducibility where one expects to find a similar result when the basic experiment is repeated, under similar but not identical circumstances, but it is an important goal in and of itself. 

One would first create a new GitHub repository for the project.
Then, identify the variables of interest and the questionnaire files they are in as well as the cycles (years) of data that will be used.  Create an Rmarkdown document and in that use the `nhanesA` package to download the relevant data.  The author will then check that document into the GitHub repository so that all updates and modifications are noted and so that anyone can check out the document.

At this point you will start to write code chunks in the document to first transform and filter the data according to the entry criteria for your study.  For example, you might want to look at blood pressure on adults over 40. On examining the `BXP` tables you find that two different blood pressure measurements (systolic and diastolic) were recorded at two different time points.  You have to decide how to process those data.  Do you take only one, or do you average both? What about people that have only one measurement? Do you keep them or remove them?  All of these decisions will impact the analysis and the actual values you report in your paper.  By including the code to do this processing in your markdown document and reader can check the code for the actual steps you took.

Then as your research progresses you will manipulate the data to compute different summary statistics, perhaps mean diastolic blood pressure by reported ethnicity.  Again the specific details of how you did that will be maintained in the markdown document.  Ultimately you will have finished your analysis and then arrange the outputs, using the tools available for processing Rmarkdown to produce the final paper for publication.
Then you can submit it. And make sure you commit everything you need (images, tables, text etc) to your GitHub repository.

Once the reviews come back you will update and modify that code and text to reflect the changes that have been asked for. And again you will check in all the files and changes. Once your paper is published you can refer interested parties to your GitHub repository where they can download the markdown documents and rerun them. Perhaps they will make changes to your assumptions to see whether the results change. 

These tools, though demanding an initial learning curve, are intuitive and efficient. As more researchers embrace these practices, the collective reliability and robustness of NHANES-based research will undoubtedly enhance. By fostering an ecosystem of transparent, replicable, and collaborative research, we can reach more informed decisions, richer insights, and a deeper understanding of the NHANES.
